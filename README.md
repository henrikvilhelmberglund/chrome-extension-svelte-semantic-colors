# svelte semantic colors chrome extension

Not super clean/functional yet! Also not on store, need to compile and load it:

1. `npm run build`
1. In your browser, go to extensions, enable developer mode, load unpacked
1. Load the build folder
1. Open a website, you should see ugly colors

One color: not very semantic
Many colors: semantic! nice!
