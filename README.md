# svelte semantic colors chrome extension

Honestly pretty broken (can't toggle) but it works:

1. `npm run build`
1. In your browser, go to extensions, enable developer mode, load unpacked
1. Load the build folder
1. Open a website, you should see ugly colors
1. If you want to disable it you need to do it through `extensions` and toggle it, then reload the page
